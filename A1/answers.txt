22. The language that the authors most closely associate with lambda calculus is LISP.
23. Data Abstraction: integer value of 5 is an abstraction of the two's complement value 101.
24. An abstract data type is a set of data values and the operations on those values. It is important because it allows programmers to define the behavior of the type but not the implementation. It provides a framework for a set of behaviors.
    For example, a computer is abstract data type but a Mac is the implementation. In Java, one can use interfaces to create abstract data types such as Lists, to create variations such as ArrayLists and LinkedLists.

25. Syntactic sugar is any mechanism that allows the programmer to replace a complex notation with shorthand notation.
    Ex: i = i + 1 -> Syntactic sugar: i++
    These two statements are interpreted the same way,  both add 1 to i.
26. The map functions takes in a list and a function as arguments  and builds and returns a list of the results of applying the said function to each element in the given list.
27. System.out.println(Hi Maria ) -> a variable cannot have a space in it
28. Compiler - takes file and generates lower level code to be read by computer.
